The main objective of this project is to allow people to create Bible related apps using XML and JSON. Do you like this idea? Help us to go even further. **Support this project! :)**

## How the files are structured?
### XML
The XML files are encoded using UTF-8 and built in the following structure:
```xml
<book>
  <chapter>
    <verse>Texto</verse>
  </chapter>
</book>
```

### JSON
The JSON files are also encoded using UTF-8 and built in the following structure:
```javascript
(
	{
	"abbrev" : "abbrev"
	"book" : "name"
	"chapters": 
		(
			{"1": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}}, {"2": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}},
			{"2": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}}, {"2": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}},
			{"3": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}}, {"2": {"1": "...", "2": "..."}}
		)
